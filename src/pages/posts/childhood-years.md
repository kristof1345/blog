Let's be real, most of us already forgot about our childhood years. We forget the things we did, how we did them and why we did them.

I think that's a huge mistake.

I wish I could remember everything I did as a kid, but my memory serves me pretty poorly.

Yet, I'm still able to pull some memories up when I'm journaling/thinking about my life.

These memories prove to be my best resource so far to know what I will like in the future.

Matter of fact...

It's my only resource.

Nobody knows me better, than I know my past self.

I'm able to dissect these memories and find out what were my motivations, what hurt me, what made me happy, what made me feel curious and excited.

To me, these memories and emotions are worth they weight in gold.

They tell me most of what I need to know about myself. And show me clues to the things I want to find out about more.

For example, recently I started thinking a lot about what I really like to do in life - when I truly feel like I'm myself, and one my starting points, and base points I keep returning to is my childhood memories of things I did and loved.

Seemingly useless memories, like searching through my grandmas drawers, can still give me insights like I loved finding novel things.

Everyone has gold in their childhood years.

You just need to dig it up from the mud.
