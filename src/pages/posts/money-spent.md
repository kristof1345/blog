Being frugal with money that you spend on yourself is dumb.

Buy shit. Whatever brings you joy.

Don't view it just as an expense necessarily. It's not. It's an investment.

I know it sounds cliche but you are one of the, if not the, biggest project of your life. Literally [[your life is a project]] you work on until you die. It's the project you keep with yourself until the last moment and beyond, and one that sums up all your past projects.

Truly, it's the most important one.

And you think this project isn't worth the investment?

That money can't just 2X or 3X.

That money has the potential(that YOU can control which is huge) to 50X or 100X or 1000000X.

Beyond that...

If it brings you joy, it's worth it.

Joy can NOT be measured in money. For me, it stands above it.
